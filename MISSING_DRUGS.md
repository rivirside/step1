# Missing Drug Coverage in `script.js`

The previously catalogued gaps in the live dataset (`script.js`) have now been addressed. Mecamylamine, Tyramine, Aliskiren, Olmesartan, Bisoprolol, Triamterene, Cephalexin, Cefuroxime, Amitriptyline, and Sumatriptan are all incorporated into their respective pharmacology sections, keeping the in-app view aligned with the high-yield outline.

This document is retained as a checkpoint so future QA passes can log any new discrepancies between the curriculum outline and the rendered data. A recent audit highlighted that the live benzodiazepine roster was narrower than the mind-map-driven scope, so the following high-yield agents were added to `script.js` for parity:

- Clonazepam (panic disorder, myoclonic seizures)
- Temazepam (maintenance insomnia)
- Oxazepam (alcohol withdrawal in hepatic dysfunction)
- Triazolam (sleep-initiation insomnia)
- Chlordiazepoxide (alcohol withdrawal protocols)

With these additions alongside the previously inserted autonomic, cardiovascular, antimicrobial, and neuropsychiatric updates, there are no outstanding omissions in the live dataset. 【F:script.js†L61-L351】【F:script.js†L440-L533】【F:script.js†L676-L715】
