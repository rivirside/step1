## 📋 Standard Development Process

### For Each Pharmacologic Class:

1. **Add `detail` object** with:
   - `overview`: What is this class? Role in therapy?
   - `clinicalApproach`: When to use? How to choose within class?
   - `pharmacokinetics`: Class-level ADME
   - `comparison`: Table comparing drugs within class (if applicable)
   - `monitoring`: What to monitor
   - `contraindications`: Class-level contraindications
   - `clinicalPearls`: Mnemonics, buzzwords, board facts

2. **Estimate**: 15-20 min per class

### For Each Drug:

1. **Enhance with comprehensive structure**:
   - `mechanism`: Detailed MOA
   - `pharmacokinetics`: Onset, peak, duration, half-life, metabolism, excretion
   - `clinicalChoice`: Why THIS drug over alternatives?
   - `dosing`: Typical, renal, hepatic, elderly, pediatric
   - `blackBoxWarnings`: FDA warnings
   - `sideEffects`: Organized by common/serious/rare
   - `interactions`: Organized by drug-drug/drug-disease/drug-food
   - `monitoring`: Labs, vitals, symptoms (organized)
   - `pregnancy`: Category and considerations
   - `clinicalPearls`: Board-relevant facts, mnemonics, vignettes

2. **Estimate**: 10-15 min per drug
