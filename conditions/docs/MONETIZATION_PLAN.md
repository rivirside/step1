# Monetization Plan

## Executive Summary

Strategy: **Hybrid Freemium Model** - Free reference content + Paid question banks
- Phase 1 (0-3 months): Launch free reference, build audience
- Phase 2 (Month 4+): Add paid question bank with minimal backend validation
- Target: $2,450 Year 1 → $24,500+ Year 3
- Effort: Low initial setup (8-16 hours), minimal ongoing (1-2 hours/month)

---

## Architecture Overview

### Current Strengths
✅ Pure client-side architecture (no database)
✅ localStorage + exportable save strings for progress
✅ Comprehensive disease/drug reference content
✅ Works offline, no login required

### Monetization Challenge
❌ Client-side only = difficult to enforce payment
❌ No backend = can't validate subscriptions
❌ JavaScript visible = easy to reverse-engineer

### Solution
**Two-tier system:**
- **FREE TIER**: All reference content (diseases, drugs, mechanisms) - fully open
- **PAID TIER**: Question banks - encrypted JSON files unlocked via license key validation

---

## Monetization Options Comparison

### OPTION 1: Gumroad + Honor System ⭐ (LOWEST EFFORT)

**Implementation:**
- Sell complete download on Gumroad ($29-49 one-time)
- No DRM, no license checks - trust-based
- Users download full app after purchase

**Effort:**
- Initial: 2-4 hours (Gumroad setup, sales page)
- Ongoing: ~0 hours (occasional support emails)

**Revenue Potential:** $3,900/year (100 sales × $39)

**Pros:**
- Zero infrastructure to maintain
- Clean user experience
- No ongoing technical debt

**Cons:**
- Will be pirated (accept as cost of business)
- No recurring revenue
- Hard to enforce updates

**Best For:** If you want absolute minimum effort and don't mind piracy

---

### OPTION 2: Free Reference + Paid Question Banks ⭐⭐⭐ (RECOMMENDED)

**Implementation:**
- Disease/drug reference: **FREE** (builds SEO, audience)
- Question banks: **PAID** ($39-79 one-time purchase)
- Encrypted question JSON files
- Simple Cloudflare Worker validates license keys
- Gumroad handles payments

**Technical Architecture:**
```javascript
// Encrypted question file
// questions/diseases/hyponatremia.encrypted.js
export default "U2FsdGVkX1+vupppZksvRf5pq5g5XjFRlipRkwB0K1Y96Qsv...";

// Cloudflare Worker (stateless validation)
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    const { licenseKey } = await request.json();
    const valid = await validateGumroadLicense(licenseKey);

    if (valid) {
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({
        decryptionKey: 'your-aes-key-here',
        expires: null
      }));
    }
    return new Response('Invalid license', { status: 403 });
  }
};

// Client-side unlock (one-time)
async function unlockQuestionBank(licenseKey) {
  const response = await fetch('https://worker.yourapp.workers.dev/validate', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ licenseKey })
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    const { decryptionKey } = await response.json();
    localStorage.setItem('qbank_unlock', decryptionKey);
    // Decrypt and load questions
  }
}
```

**Effort:**
- Initial: 8-16 hours (encryption system, Cloudflare Worker, Gumroad integration)
- Ongoing: 1-2 hours/month (edge case handling)

**Costs:**
- Cloudflare Workers: $0-5/month (likely free tier sufficient)
- Gumroad fees: 10% + payment processing (~13% total)
- Domain: $12/year

**Revenue Potential:**
- Year 1: 50 sales × $49 = **$2,450**
- Year 2: 200 sales × $49 = **$9,800**
- Year 3: 500 sales × $49 = **$24,500**

**Pros:**
- Free tier = viral growth + SEO ranking
- Questions are the real value (reference is commodity)
- Still mostly client-side architecture
- Simple stateless backend
- Harder to pirate than honor system
- Can charge premium pricing ($50-79 for 1000+ questions)

**Cons:**
- Requires minimal backend maintenance

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Encryption System

**Tools:**
- CryptoJS (AES-256 encryption)
- Web Crypto API (browser-native, more secure)

**Process:**
1. Create questions in plain JSON
2. Encrypt during build process
3. Ship encrypted files to users
4. Decrypt client-side only after license validation

**Example Build Script:**
```javascript
// scripts/encrypt-questions.js
const CryptoJS = require('crypto-js');
const fs = require('fs');

const SECRET_KEY = process.env.QBANK_ENCRYPTION_KEY;
const questionsDir = './questions/encrypted/';

// Read all question files
const files = fs.readdirSync('./questions/plain/');

files.forEach(file => {
  const plaintext = fs.readFileSync(`./questions/plain/${file}`, 'utf8');
  const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, SECRET_KEY).toString();

  fs.writeFileSync(
    `${questionsDir}/${file}`,
    `export default "${encrypted}";`
  );
});

console.log(`Encrypted ${files.length} question files`);
```

**Decryption Client-Side:**
```javascript
// Only runs after license validation
function decryptQuestions(encryptedData, key) {
  const bytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedData, key);
  const decrypted = bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
  return JSON.parse(decrypted);
}
```

---

### License Validation Flow

```
User purchases on Gumroad
  ↓
Receives license key via email
  ↓
Enters key in app
  ↓
App sends key to Cloudflare Worker
  ↓
Worker validates against Gumroad API
  ↓
If valid: returns decryption key
  ↓
App stores decryption key in localStorage
  ↓
Questions decrypt and load
  ↓
User can export save state (decryption key included)
```

**Gumroad Integration:**
```javascript
// Cloudflare Worker
async function validateGumroadLicense(licenseKey) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.gumroad.com/v2/licenses/verify', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      product_id: 'your_product_id',
      license_key: licenseKey,
      increment_uses_count: false // Don't count validation as a use
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.success === true;
}
```

### Anti-Piracy Considerations

**Will it be pirated?** Yes, eventually. Accept this.

**How to minimize piracy:**
- Don't make it trivial (encryption adds friction)
- Price fairly ($39-79 is impulse-buy range for med students)
- Provide excellent support to paying customers
- Regular updates only for licensed users
- Build community around supporting development

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't use invasive DRM (hurts paying customers)
- Don't require always-online checks (defeats offline use)
- Don't make license transfer difficult (students share devices)
- Don't obsess over piracy (focus on serving paying customers well)

**Real-world example:** Anki medical decks are heavily pirated, but AnKing still makes $10K+/month on Patreon because people want to support quality + get updates.

---

## Marketing Strategy

### Target Audience
- **Primary:** US/Canadian medical students (M1-M2) preparing for USMLE Step 1
- **Secondary:** International medical graduates (IMGs) studying for USMLE
- **Tertiary:** PA/NP students, residents reviewing basics

### Channels

**Reddit (Free, High-Value):**
- r/medicalschool (450K members)
- r/step1 (50K members)
- Post as "Free USMLE reference tool I built" (authentic, not spammy)
- Engage in weekly question threads
- Offer early access to active community members

**Student Doctor Network (Free):**
- USMLE forum posts
- Link in signature
- Respond to "best Step 1 resources" threads

**Medical School Ambassadors:**
- Reach out to 10-20 med students at different schools
- Offer free lifetime access in exchange for feedback + sharing
- They become organic evangelists

**SEO (Long-term, Free):**
- Your free content ranks for "[disease name] step 1"
- Blog posts: "How to approach [topic] for USMLE"
- Question bank pages link back to reference content

**Paid (Later, if budget allows):**
- Google Ads for "USMLE Step 1 questions" ($1-3 CPC)
- Facebook Med School groups (cheap, targeted)
- Sponsorship from medical YouTube channels

## Financial Projections

### Conservative Scenario (Base Case)

**Year 1:**
- Revenue: $2,450 (50 sales × $49)
- Costs: $100 (domain, Cloudflare, Gumroad fees included in per-sale)
- Net: $2,350
- Time investment: 60 hours (question creation + setup)
- Effective hourly: $39/hour

**Year 2:**
- Revenue: $9,800 (200 sales × $49)
- Costs: $100
- Net: $9,700
- Time investment: 40 hours (updates, support)
- Effective hourly: $242/hour

**Year 3:**
- Revenue: $24,500 (500 sales × $49)
- Costs: $200 (minor infrastructure)
- Net: $24,300
- Time investment: 60 hours (major updates)
- Effective hourly: $405/hour

### Optimistic Scenario

**If you nail product-market fit:**
- Year 3: 1,500 sales × $69 = $103,500
- Add Step 2 CK bank: +$50,000
- Institutional licenses (5 schools × $5,000) = $25,000
- **Total Year 3: $178,500**

**Comparable success stories:**
- AnKing (Anki decks): $10K+/month Patreon = $120K+/year
- Pixorize: $50/month subscription, thousands of users = $1M+/year
- Sketchy Medical: Acquired for $50M+ (started as small team)

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't build complex subscription system** - too much ongoing effort
❌ **Don't DRM the reference content** - it's your marketing funnel
❌ **Don't require login for free tier** - friction kills adoption
❌ **Don't overthink anti-piracy** - some piracy helps awareness
❌ **Don't underprice** - med students pay $400 for UWorld, $49 is nothing
❌ **Don't abandon free users** - they're your word-of-mouth engine

---

## Success Metrics to Track

### Free Tier (Growth)
- Weekly active users
- Pages per session (engagement)
- Time on site
- Search ranking for key terms
- Social media mentions
- Email list growth

### Paid Tier (Revenue)
- Conversion rate (free → paid)
- Average sale price
- Refund rate
- Customer support tickets
- User reviews/testimonials
- Repeat purchase rate (for future products)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Week 1):**
   - Create QUESTION_PLAN.md document
   - Set up Gumroad account
   - Design question unlock UI mockups

2. **Short-term (Month 1):**
   - Write 50 sample questions for 5 diseases
   - Build encryption/decryption system
   - Deploy Cloudflare Worker
   - Test full purchase flow

3. **Medium-term (Months 2-3):**
   - Create 500-1000 questions across all renal diseases
   - Gather beta testers from Reddit
   - Refine based on feedback
   - Prepare launch marketing

4. **Launch (Month 4):**
   - Public launch on Reddit, SDN
   - Email waitlist
   - Monitor conversion rates
   - Iterate based on user feedback

---

## Conclusion

**Recommended approach:** Free reference + Paid question banks (Option 2)

**Why this wins:**
- Leverages your existing free content as marketing
- Questions are where the real value is for USMLE prep
- Minimal backend (just stateless validation)
- Sustainable revenue with low ongoing effort
- Aligned with how medical students actually study
- Room to scale into additional products

**Bottom line:** Your client-side architecture is perfect for the free reference. Add a thin validation layer for premium question banks. This minimizes effort while creating a real revenue stream. The questions are where the value is anyway - the reference material is commodity that builds your audience.

**Estimated effort:** 60 hours initial setup → 2-4 hours/month ongoing = very manageable for solo developer

**Estimated revenue:** $2,500 Year 1 → $25,000+ Year 3 (conservative) → $100K+ Year 3 (optimistic)
