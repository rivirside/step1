            definition: "Deep vein thrombosis is formation of blood clot in deep veins, usually lower extremities (femoral, popliteal, iliac). Part of venous thromboembolism (VTE) spectrum with pulmonary embolism. Can cause pulmonary embolism (life-threatening) and post-thrombotic syndrome (chronic venous insufficiency).",

Clot forms in deep veins → obstruction → venous congestion, edema, pain. Clot can embolize to pulmonary arteries → PE. Untreated DVT: 50% risk of PE. Proximal DVT (above knee) higher risk of PE than distal (below knee).",
