Three types: pauci-immune (ANCA+, most common), anti-GBM (Goodpasture syndrome), and immune complex-mediated (lupus, PSGN, IgA).",
            pathophysiology: "Severe glomerular injury → disruption of glomerular capillary walls → leakage of fibrin/inflammatory cells into Bowman's space → crescent formation (proliferating epithelial cells + macrophages). Crescents compress glomerular tuft → ↓ GFR. If untreated, crescents become fibrotic (irreversible scarring). Pauci-immune (50-60%): ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation → necrotizing vasculitis of glomeruli. No immune deposits on immunofluorescence (hence \"pauci-immune\"). Anti-GBM (10-20%): autoantibodies to type IV collagen in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes → linear IgG on immunofluorescence. Goodpasture syndrome = anti-GBM + pulmonary hemorrhage. Immune complex (30-40%): deposition of immune complexes in glomeruli → granular immunofluorescence. Causes: lupus, PSGN, IgA nephropathy, cryoglobulinemia.

            definition: "Distal RTA (type 1) = defective distal tubule/collecting duct H+ secretion → inability to acidify urine (urine pH >5.5 despite systemic acidosis) → chronic metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap. Classic triad: non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (↓ HCO3, normal Cl), hypokalemia (paradoxical alkaline urine → ↑ K+ wasting), nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis (alkaline urine → Ca phosphate precipitation). Most common RTA in adults (vs type 2 in children). Can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (autoimmune, drugs, obstruction).",
            pathophysiology: "Normal distal tubule: intercalated cells secrete H+ (via H+-ATPase) into lumen → acidifies urine to pH 4.5-5.5 → regenerates HCO3 (returns to blood). Distal RTA defect: α-intercalated cells cannot secrete H+ (or increased H+ permeability back into blood) → urine pH remains >5.5 (alkaline) despite systemic acidosis. Mechanisms: (1) defective H+-ATPase (primary genetic mutations in ATP6V1B1, ATP6V0A4), (2) increased H+ backleak (amphotericin B damages tubule), (3) impaired H+ gradient (urinary obstruction). Consequences: (1) Chronic acidosis: ↓ HCO3 reabsorption → normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (hyperchloremic). (2) Hypokalemia: alkaline urine → ↑ K+/H+ exchange in collecting duct → K+ wasting. Also, chronic acidosis → K+ shifts out of cells (to buffer H+), then lost in urine. (3) Hypercalciuria: chronic acidosis → bone buffering (Ca release from bone) + ↓ proximal tubule Ca reabsorption → ↑ urine Ca. Alkaline urine (pH >6) + ↑ Ca → Ca phosphate precipitation → nephrolithiasis (Ca phosphate stones), nephrocalcinosis (renal parenchymal calcification). (4) Bone disease: chronic acidosis + bone buffering → osteomalacia (adults), rickets (children). (5) Growth failure (children): acidosis impairs GH secretion + bone growth.",

Often part of Fanconi syndrome (generalized proximal tubular dysfunction → bicarbonaturia + glucosuria + phosphaturia + aminoaciduria). Most common RTA in children (vs type 1 in adults). Causes: hereditary (cystinosis, Wilson's disease), acquired (multiple myeloma, tenofovir, ifosfamide, acetazolamide).",
            pathophysiology: "Normal proximal tubule: reabsorbs 80-90% of filtered HCO3 (via Na-H exchanger NHE3 + H+-ATPase → HCO3 returns to blood). Proximal RTA defect: impaired HCO3 reabsorption → HCO3 spills into urine (bicarbonaturia) → serum HCO3 drops → metabolic acidosis. Mechanism: (1) genetic defects in NHE3 (SLC9A3), Na-HCO3 cotransporter (NBC1/SLC4A4), carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), or H+-ATPase, (2) acquired tubular damage (drugs, toxins, dysproteinemias). Once serum HCO3 drops to ~15 mEq/L, filtered HCO3 load ↓ → proximal tubule reabsorbs all remaining HCO3 → no more bicarbonaturia → distal tubule can acidify urine to pH <5.5 (\"new steady state\"). Fanconi syndrome: generalized proximal tubular dysfunction (not just HCO3). Impaired reabsorption of glucose (glucosuria despite normal blood glucose), phosphate (phosphaturia → rickets/osteomalacia), amino acids (aminoaciduria), uric acid (hypouricemia), low-molecular-weight proteins (β2-microglobulinuria). Consequences: (1) Chronic acidosis (HCO3 12-18 mEq/L, non-anion gap). (2) Hypokalemia: HCO3 delivery to distal tubule → ↑ Na reabsorption → ↑ K+ secretion (same as distal RTA). (3) Bone disease (if Fanconi): phosphate wasting → hypophosphatemia → rickets (children), osteomalacia (adults). Acidosis + bone buffering worsens bone disease.

Untreated: ESRD by age 10, death by age 20 (uremia). With cysteamine (started in infancy): ESRD delayed to age 20-30, but inevitable (70% on dialysis by age 20, 90% by age 30).

Quality of life impaired (photophobia, muscle weakness, cognitive decline in 30s-40s). Compliance critical (q6h dosing, bad taste/smell → poor adherence → faster progression). Wilson's disease: excellent prognosis if diagnosed early and treated with chelation. Liver disease stabilizes/improves, neurologic symptoms may improve (50%), Fanconi may persist (tubular damage often irreversible). Untreated: death by age 30-40 (liver failure, neurologic decline). Delay in diagnosis → irreversible neurologic/hepatic damage. Dent's disease: progressive CKD despite treatment. ESRD by age 30-50 in 50-80%. Recurrent nephrolithiasis (painful, costly interventions). Short stature common. Lifespan near-normal with transplant. Lowe syndrome: poor prognosis. Severe intellectual disability, seizures, blindness (cataracts/glaucoma), CKD. High mortality (50% die by age 30-40 from infections, CKD). No cure, supportive care only. Multiple myeloma: prognosis depends on myeloma stage, response to chemotherapy. Fanconi often irreversible (tubular damage). Median survival 5-10 years (improved with novel agents: bortezomib, lenalidomide). CKD common (50%), dialysis in 20-30%. Drug-induced Fanconi (tenofovir, ifosfamide): variable prognosis. If drug stopped early → Fanconi may reverse (weeks-months, but often incomplete).

            definition: "Type 4 RTA = non-anion gap metabolic acidosis + hyperkalemia (K+ >5.5 mEq/L) from aldosterone deficiency or resistance. Most common RTA overall (especially in adults >50 years). Classic causes: diabetic nephropathy (most common, hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism), CKD, medications (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, K+-sparing diuretics, heparin, calcineurin inhibitors). Urine pH <5.5 (can acidify urine, unlike type 1). Mechanism: ↓ aldosterone → ↓ distal tubule K+ secretion (hyperkalemia) + ↓ H+ secretion (acidosis). Mild acidosis (HCO3 17-22 mEq/L) compared to types 1/2. Often asymptomatic, discovered on routine labs.",
            pathophysiology: "Normal aldosterone action: binds mineralocorticoid receptor in principal cells of collecting duct → ↑ ENaC (epithelial Na channel) → ↑ Na reabsorption → creates lumen-negative potential → drives K+ secretion (via ROMK) + H+ secretion (via α-intercalated cells). Type 4 RTA defect: aldosterone deficiency or resistance → ↓ Na reabsorption → ↓ lumen-negative potential → ↓ K+ secretion (hyperkalemia) + ↓ H+ secretion (acidosis). Hyperkalemia also directly inhibits NH3 synthesis in proximal tubule → ↓ NH4+ excretion → ↓ acid excretion (worsens acidosis). Two subtypes: (1) Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (most common, 70%): ↓ renin → ↓ angiotensin II → ↓ aldosterone. Caused by diabetic nephropathy (autonomic neuropathy → ↓ renin release), chronic interstitial nephritis, NSAIDs (↓ renin release), elderly (↓ renin with age). (2) Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism (30%): ↑ renin but ↓ aldosterone. Caused by primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease, autoimmune, TB, hemorrhage → ↓ cortisol + ↓ aldosterone), aldosterone synthase deficiency (genetic), heparin (blocks aldosterone synthesis), ACE inhibitors/ARBs (↓ angiotensin II → ↓ aldosterone). (3) Aldosterone resistance (rare): normal/↑ aldosterone but kidney doesn't respond. Caused by K+-sparing diuretics (amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone, eplerenone), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, cyclosporine), urinary obstruction, lupus nephritis, sickle cell disease. Consequences: (1) Hyperkalemia (K+ 5.5-7.0 mEq/L, life-threatening arrhythmias if >7.5). (2) Mild metabolic acidosis (HCO3 17-22 mEq/L, non-anion gap). Acidosis is mild because GFR usually preserved (vs severe acidosis in CKD Stage 4-5). (3) Normal urine pH (<5.5, distal tubule can still acidify urine once H+ secretion partially impaired, unlike type 1 which cannot acidify at all). (4) Low NH4+ excretion (hyperkalemia → ↓ NH3 synthesis).",
            epidemiology: "Most common RTA (prevalence 5-10% in diabetics with CKD, 10-20% in CKD Stage 3-4). Age: typically >50 years (diabetic nephropathy, CKD, elderly). Male = female (except drug-induced, more common in elderly on polypharmacy). Race: more common in African Americans (↑ diabetes, ↑ hypertension → CKD). Associated conditions: diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2, especially with diabetic nephropathy), CKD (GFR 30-60 mL/min), medications (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, K+-sparing diuretics in 80% of cases), adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), HIV (adrenal insufficiency from infections, medications).

            definition: "Type 3 RTA (mixed RTA) = rare disorder combining features of type 1 (distal) and type 2 (proximal) RTA. Originally described as transient mixed RTA in infants, but now reclassified. Modern use: carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) deficiency = AR genetic disorder (CA2 gene mutations) causing proximal + distal RTA. Classic triad: RTA (mixed proximal + distal features) + osteopetrosis (marble bone disease, dense bones) + cerebral calcifications (basal ganglia). Extremely rare (1 in 1 million). Historical note: Type 3 RTA originally referred to transient RTA in infants (now recognized as severe type 1 RTA that improves with age). CA-II deficiency is the only true \"mixed\" RTA.",
            pathophysiology: "Carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II): enzyme catalyzes reversible reaction: CO2 + H2O ↔ H2CO3 ↔ H+ + HCO3-. Present in multiple tissues: (1) Proximal tubule: CA-II facilitates HCO3 reabsorption (converts HCO3 to CO2 → diffuses into cell → reconverted to HCO3 by CA-II → returns to blood). (2) Distal tubule/collecting duct: CA-II facilitates H+ secretion (generates H+ from CO2 + H2O → secreted into lumen). (3) Osteoclasts: CA-II generates H+ → acidifies resorption lacuna → dissolves bone mineral (Ca phosphate). (4) Brain: CA-II regulates CSF pH, ion transport. CA-II deficiency (AR, CA2 gene mutations): (1) Proximal RTA: ↓ HCO3 reabsorption → bicarbonaturia (similar to type 2). FEHCO3 >15% when HCO3 normalized. (2) Distal RTA: ↓ H+ secretion → urine pH >5.5 despite acidosis (similar to type 1). Nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis (from alkaline urine + hypercalciuria). (3) Osteopetrosis: ↓ osteoclast function (cannot acidify resorption lacuna) → ↓ bone resorption → dense bones (\"marble bone disease\"). Bones are abnormally dense but brittle (pathologic fractures). Narrow marrow cavity → pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) from marrow failure. Skull thickening → cranial nerve compression (optic nerve → blindness, facial nerve → facial palsy, vestibulocochlear → deafness). (4) Cerebral calcifications: ↓ CA-II in brain → abnormal Ca deposition in basal ganglia, periventricular regions. Mechanism unclear. Associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability. (5) Hypokalemia: similar to types 1/2 (distal K+ wasting from alkaline urine). (6) Chronic metabolic acidosis: non-anion gap, HCO3 12-18 mEq/L.

            prognosis: "Prognosis variable, depends on severity of pancytopenia, vision loss, and timing of HSCT. Untreated: poor prognosis. Blindness (50-70% by age 10), severe anemia/thrombocytopenia (transfusion-dependent), recurrent infections (10-20% mortality from sepsis), pathologic fractures, growth failure (<5th percentile), intellectual disability (70%). Median survival ~20-30 years (death from infections, intracranial hemorrhage, complications of anemia). With HSCT (before age 2 years): excellent prognosis for hematologic/skeletal features. Reverses pancytopenia (>70% cure rate, transfusion-independent), halts vision loss (if done before optic nerve damage), improves bone density (partially, bone remodeling slow). Lifespan near-normal (>50 years). Complications despite HSCT: RTA persists (lifelong alkali therapy required), cerebral calcifications persist (developmental delay/seizures in 20-30%), vision loss if HSCT delayed (irreversible), hearing loss progressive (30-50% need hearing aids), fractures (less common post-HSCT but still occur). Vision: if HSCT before age 2 years → 70-80% retain vision. If HSCT after age 5 years → 50% already blind, no improvement. Optic nerve decompression (salvage): limited efficacy (20-30% stabilize vision, rarely improves). Growth: with aggressive alkali therapy + phosphate/vitamin D → catch-up growth possible (final height 5th-25th percentile). Without treatment → severe short stature (<5th percentile). Intellectual disability: non-progressive, but 70% have mild-moderate disability (special education needs). Key message: Early HSCT (before age 2) = best prognosis (prevents blindness, cures pancytopenia). Delayed HSCT or no HSCT → poor prognosis (blindness, transfusion-dependent, infections).

Severity: mild (130-134 mEq/L, often asymptomatic), moderate (125-129 mEq/L, symptoms variable), severe (<125 mEq/L, neurologic symptoms common). Acute (<48h, symptomatic, risk of cerebral edema) vs chronic (>48h, often asymptomatic, brain adapted). Key complication: cerebral edema (if acute/severe) or osmotic demyelination syndrome (if corrected too rapidly). Diagnostic approach: assess volume status (hypovolemic vs euvolemic vs hypervolemic) → measure urine osmolality and urine Na → determine etiology (SIADH, diuretics, heart failure, cirrhosis, adrenal insufficiency, psychogenic polydipsia, beer potomania).",
            pathophysiology: "Normal Na regulation: serum Na maintained 135-145 mEq/L by balance of water intake (thirst) + water excretion (ADH). Hyponatremia mechanisms: (1) ↑ ADH (SIADH, volume depletion, CHF, cirrhosis) → ↑ free water reabsorption in collecting duct → ↓ Na. (2) ↑ water intake (psychogenic polydipsia, beer potomania) → overwhelms kidney's ability to excrete free water (max 15-20 L/day) → dilutional hyponatremia. (3) Impaired free water excretion (CKD, thiazide diuretics, hypothyroidism) → water retention → ↓ Na. (4) Na loss (diuretics, vomiting, diarrhea, cerebral salt wasting, renal salt wasting) + hypotonic fluid replacement → ↓ Na. Volume status classification: (1) Hypovolemic (↓ total body Na + ↓ total body water, but ↓ Na > ↓ water): renal losses (diuretics, osmotic diuresis, salt-wasting nephropathy) or GI losses (vomiting, diarrhea). Physical exam: ↓ skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, orthostatic hypotension, ↑ HR. Urine Na <20 mEq/L (if extrarenal losses, kidney conserving Na) or >20 mEq/L (if renal losses). (2) Euvolemic (normal total body Na, ↑ total body water): SIADH (most common), hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, psychogenic polydipsia, beer potomania. Physical exam: normal. Urine Na >20 mEq/L (except psychogenic polydipsia/beer potomania, urine Na <20). (3) Hypervolemic (↑ total body Na + ↑ total body water, but ↑ water > ↑ Na): CHF, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, CKD. Physical exam: edema, ascites, ↑ JVP. Urine Na <20 mEq/L (kidney retaining Na). Cerebral edema (acute hyponatremia, Na <120 mEq/L): ↓ serum osmolality → water shifts into brain cells → swelling → ↑ ICP → herniation (life-threatening). Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS, formerly central pontine myelinolysis): rapid Na correction (>10-12 mEq/L in 24h, or >18 mEq/L in 48h) → brain cells cannot readapt → myelin sheath damage in pons, basal ganglia → quadriparesis, dysarthria, dysphagia, locked-in syndrome (irreversible).",

Chronic hyponatremia: more common in elderly (↑ SIADH, ↑ thiazide use, ↑ CHF/cirrhosis). SIADH: 30-40% of hyponatremia cases. Thiazide diuretics: 10-20% of hyponatremia (especially elderly women). CHF/cirrhosis: 10-20%. Mortality: ↑ in hospitalized patients with hyponatremia (hazard ratio 1.5-2.0 vs normonatremia, likely reflects underlying illness severity).

            definition: "Hypernatremia = serum Na >145 mEq/L (normal 135-145 mEq/L). Reflects water deficit relative to Na (not necessarily Na excess). Prevalence 1-2% hospitalized patients, but higher mortality than hyponatremia (40-60% mortality in severe cases, often reflects underlying illness severity). More common in elderly, ICU patients, infants (impaired thirst/access to water). Always indicates hyperosmolality (unlike hyponatremia which can be hypotonic, isotonic, or hypertonic). Osmolality = 2 × Na + glucose/18 + BUN/2.8 (normal 275-295 mOsm/kg).",
            pathophysiology: "Normal Na regulation: serum Na maintained 135-145 mEq/L by balance of water intake (thirst) + water excretion (ADH). Hypernatremia mechanisms: (1) ↓ water intake (impaired thirst, no access to water), (2) ↑ water loss (renal: diabetes insipidus, osmotic diuresis; extrarenal: GI losses, insensible losses), (3) Na gain (hypertonic saline, salt tablets, saltwater drowning—rare). Water deficit formula: water deficit (L) = 0.6 × weight (kg) × [(serum Na / 140) - 1]. Volume status approach (similar to hyponatremia but assess urine osmolality for renal vs extrarenal loss): Hypovolemic hypernatremia (most common, 70%): ↓ total body water + ↓ total body Na (but water loss > Na loss). Causes: GI losses (diarrhea, vomiting), insensible losses (fever, burns, sweating), osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia, mannitol). Urine osmolality >700 mOsm/kg (appropriate renal concentration) → extrarenal loss. Euvolemic hypernatremia (20%): ↓ total body water, normal total body Na. Causes: diabetes insipidus (DI, central or nephrogenic), hypodipsia (impaired thirst, elderly, hypothalamic lesions), insensible losses (tachypnea, fever). Urine osmolality <300 mOsm/kg (dilute urine despite hyperosmolality) → DI. Hypervolemic hypernatremia (rare, 10%): ↑ total body Na > ↑ total body water. Causes: hypertonic saline infusion, primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing syndrome, saltwater ingestion. Diabetes insipidus (DI): inability to concentrate urine. Central DI: ↓ ADH secretion (hypothalamus/pituitary damage: trauma, surgery, tumor, Sheehan syndrome, idiopathic). Nephrogenic DI: kidney resistance to ADH (collecting duct defect). Causes: lithium (most common drug cause), hypercalcemia (↓ ADH sensitivity), hypokalemia, tubulointerstitial disease, genetic (AQP2 mutation). Water deprivation test: differentiate psychogenic polydipsia vs central vs nephrogenic DI. Step 1: Deprive water → urine osmolality <300 mOsm/kg = DI. Step 2: Give desmopressin → urine osmolality ↑ >50% = central DI (responds to ADH). Urine osmolality ↑ <50% = nephrogenic DI (no response to ADH). Cerebral edema risk: rapid correction of chronic hypernatremia → water moves into brain cells (osmotic gradient) → cerebral edema, seizures, permanent neurologic damage. Brain adapts to chronic hypernatremia by ↑ intracellular osmoles (idiogenic osmoles) → takes 48h to dissipate → correct slowly (↓ Na by 10-12 mEq/L in 24h, max 0.5 mEq/L/h). Acute hypernatremia (<48h, e.g., saltwater ingestion): no brain adaptation → can correct faster (↓ Na by 1 mEq/L/h). Correction too fast → cerebral edema. Correction too slow → prolonged hyperosmolality → brain shrinkage, venous sinus thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage.",

            definition: "Hypokalemia = serum K <3.5 mEq/L (normal 3.5-5.0 mEq/L). Common electrolyte disorder (prevalence 10-40% hospitalized patients, especially on diuretics). K is primarily intracellular cation (98% intracellular, 2% extracellular) → serum K does NOT accurately reflect total body K stores. Severity: mild 3.0-3.5 mEq/L (often asymptomatic), moderate 2.5-3.0 mEq/L (muscle weakness, arrhythmias), severe <2.5 mEq/L (paralysis, life-threatening arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis). Every 1 mEq/L ↓ in serum K ≈ 100-200 mEq total body K deficit (rough estimate, varies with chronicity).",
            pathophysiology: "Normal K regulation: serum K 3.5-5.0 mEq/L. K distribution: 98% intracellular (140 mEq/L inside cells, 4 mEq/L in serum). Maintained by Na-K-ATPase pump (3 Na out, 2 K in). K balance: intake (diet 50-100 mEq/day) = excretion (urine 90%, stool 10%). Kidney regulates K via distal tubule + collecting duct (principal cells: ENaC reabsorbs Na, ROMK secretes K; aldosterone ↑ both → net K secretion). Hypokalemia mechanisms: (1) Transcellular shift (K moves into cells, total body K normal): insulin (↑ Na-K-ATPase), β2-agonists (albuterol, ↑ Na-K-ATPase), alkalosis (H+ leaves cells, K enters to maintain electroneutrality), hypokalemic periodic paralysis (genetic, triggered by high carbs/exercise). (2) GI losses (diarrhea, vomiting, laxatives, villous adenoma). Vomiting → hypokalemia via metabolic alkalosis (not direct K loss): vomit = HCl loss → alkalosis → kidney excretes HCO3 + K (to reabsorb Na). (3) Renal losses (most common chronic cause): diuretics (loop: furosemide, thiazide: HCTZ), hyperaldosteronism (primary: adenoma, bilateral hyperplasia; secondary: CHF, cirrhosis, renal artery stenosis), RTA type 1 (distal RTA, hypokalemia from urine K wasting), RTA type 2 (proximal RTA, bicarbonaturia → ↑ distal Na delivery → ↑ K secretion), Bartter/Gitelman (genetic tubulopathies mimicking loop/thiazide diuretics), hypomagnesemia (Mg required for ROMK function → Mg deficiency → K wasting, refractory hypokalemia until Mg repleted). (4) Poor intake (rare isolated cause, usually combined with other mechanisms, anorexia, alcoholism). Urine K approach: urine K <20 mEq/day (or spot UK/UCr <13 mEq/g) → extrarenal loss (GI, transcellular shift, poor intake) + appropriate renal K conservation. Urine K >20 mEq/day (or UK/UCr >13) → renal K wasting (diuretics, hyperaldosteronism, RTA, Mg deficiency). TTKG (transtubular potassium gradient, outdated): UK/UK × Posm/Uosm. TTKG <3 → extrarenal loss. TTKG >7 → renal loss. Now mostly replaced by 24h urine K or spot UK/UCr. Acid-base status: hypokalemia + metabolic alkalosis → vomiting, diuretics, hyperaldosteronism, Bartter/Gitelman. Hypokalemia + metabolic acidosis → diarrhea, RTA type 1/2, DKA (initial hyperkalemia, then hypokalemia after insulin treatment). EKG changes: hypokalemia → (1) U waves (most specific, positive deflection after T wave, best seen V2-V3), (2) T wave flattening/inversion, (3) ST depression, (4) prolonged PR interval, (5) prolonged QT (actually QU, mimics long QT), (6) arrhythmias (PVCs, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes if severe). Severe hypokalemia (<2.5) → ventricular fibrillation, asystole. Digoxin toxicity ↑ with hypokalemia (K competes with digoxin for Na-K-ATPase → low K → more digoxin binding → toxicity). Muscle effects: hypokalemia → ↓ muscle excitability (hyperpolarization, resting membrane potential more negative) → weakness, cramping, paralysis (severe). Renal effects: chronic hypokalemia → tubulointerstitial injury (hypokalemic nephropathy), nephrogenic DI (↓ ADH sensitivity), ↑ renal ammonia production → metabolic alkalosis.",

            definition: "Hyperkalemia = serum K >5.0 mEq/L (normal 3.5-5.0 mEq/L). Life-threatening electrolyte disorder (can cause sudden cardiac death from arrhythmias). Severity: mild 5.0-5.9 mEq/L (often asymptomatic, EKG changes minimal), moderate 6.0-6.9 mEq/L (EKG changes, peaked T waves, muscle weakness), severe ≥7.0 mEq/L (life-threatening, wide QRS, sine wave, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest). Prevalence 1-10% hospitalized patients, higher in CKD (20-50% CKD stage 4-5), elderly, patients on ACEi/ARBs + spironolactone. Pseudohyperkalemia (falsely elevated K): most common cause of K >6.0 without symptoms/EKG changes. Caused by hemolysis (sample handling, prolonged tourniquet, fist clenching, traumatic venipuncture), thrombocytosis (platelets >500k release K during clotting), leukocytosis (WBC >100k, leukemia). Always recheck K if >6.0 and asymptomatic with normal EKG.",
            pathophysiology: "Normal K regulation: serum K 3.5-5.0 mEq/L. K distribution: 98% intracellular (140 mEq/L inside cells, 4 mEq/L in serum). K excretion: 90% urine (kidney), 10% stool. Kidney regulates K via distal tubule + collecting duct (principal cells: ENaC reabsorbs Na, ROMK secretes K; aldosterone ↑ both → net K secretion). Hyperkalemia mechanisms: (1) ↑ K intake (rare alone, requires impaired excretion): K supplements, salt substitutes (KCl-based), blood transfusions (stored RBCs release K), IV KCl (iatrogenic). (2) Transcellular shift (K moves out of cells): acidosis (metabolic acidosis → H+ enters cells, K exits to maintain electroneutrality; 0.6 mEq/L ↑ K per 0.1 ↓ pH), insulin deficiency (DKA, ↓ Na-K-ATPase), β-blocker overdose (↓ Na-K-ATPase), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (genetic, triggered by exercise/fasting), massive cell lysis (rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, hemolysis, burns). (3) ↓ renal K excretion (most common chronic cause): CKD/ESRD (GFR <15, ↓ nephron mass → ↓ K secretion), AKI (oliguria, ↓ GFR), hypoaldosteronism (Addison disease, Type 4 RTA, ACEi/ARBs/spironolactone → ↓ aldosterone → ↓ K secretion), K-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, eplerenone → block aldosterone or ENaC), NSAIDs (↓ renin → ↓ aldosterone). Cardiac effects (CRITICAL): hyperkalemia → ↑ resting membrane potential (less negative, e.g., -90 mV → -80 mV) → ↑ excitability initially (peaked T waves) → but inactivates Na channels → ↓ excitability with severe hyperkalemia → prolonged PR, wide QRS, sine wave, asystole. EKG progression (K ↑): (1) Peaked T waves (narrow, tall, symmetric, K 5.5-6.5, earliest change), (2) PR prolongation + P wave flattening (K 6.5-7.5), (3) QRS widening (K 7.0-8.0, wide QRS >0.12s, \"sine wave\" if severe), (4) Ventricular arrhythmias (VF, asystole, K >8.0). EKG changes correlate poorly with K level (some patients have K 7.0 with normal EKG, others have wide QRS at K 6.0) → treat based on EKG, not just K value. Type 4 RTA (hyperkalemic RTA): hypoaldosteronism → ↓ H+ secretion (distal tubule) + ↓ K secretion → hyperkalemia + non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.

                "AKI worsening (if hyperkalemia due to AKI): hyperkalemia → cardiac arrest → hypoperfusion → worsening AKI (vicious cycle). Also rhabdomyolysis → AKI → hyperkalemia → arrhythmia. Dialysis breaks cycle",

Presents with abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, peritonitis, shock. CT: colonic wall thickening, pneumatosis. Surgery if perforation. Avoid Kayexalate + sorbitol (use patiromer/Lokelma instead)",
                "Rebound hyperkalemia (after initial treatment): K shifts into cells with insulin/albuterol (temporary, 4-6h) → then K redistributes back → rebound hyperkalemia 4-12h later if not removed from body (Kayexalate, furosemide, dialysis). Monitor K q2-4h for 12-24h after acute treatment"

            prognosis: "Mild hyperkalemia (K 5.0-5.9): excellent prognosis with dietary K restriction + loop diuretics or K binders (patiromer). Most CKD patients tolerate chronic K 5.0-5.5 without symptoms if EKG normal. Moderate hyperkalemia (K 6.0-6.9): good prognosis if treated promptly (insulin, albuterol, furosemide). Risk of sudden arrhythmia ↑ → requires telemetry, frequent K monitoring. Severe hyperkalemia (K ≥7.0, wide QRS): high mortality (20-40%) if cardiac arrest occurs. If treated immediately (Ca gluconate, insulin, dialysis) before arrest → most survive without sequelae. Cardiac arrest from hyperkalemia: survival 30-50% (worse than other causes of arrest). Neurologic outcomes poor if prolonged resuscitation. CKD/ESRD: chronic hyperkalemia common (40-50% have K >5.0), requires lifelong low-K diet, K binders (patiromer), dialysis (HD 3x/week). Hyperkalemia = leading cause of sudden death in dialysis patients (between HD sessions, especially after long weekend gap—Monday/Tuesday highest mortality). Type 4 RTA: excellent prognosis with fludrocortisone + furosemide (normalizes K, corrects acidosis). Most patients maintain K 4.0-5.0 long-term. Addison disease: excellent prognosis with lifelong hydrocortisone + fludrocortisone (normalizes K, BP, cortisol). Adrenal crisis (if untreated): mortality 50-90% (hypotension, shock, hyperkalemia). DKA: hyperkalemia at presentation common (40%), but total body K depleted → after insulin → severe hypokalemia. With appropriate K repletion → most recover, K normalizes. Tumor lysis syndrome: high mortality (10-20%) if severe AKI + refractory hyperkalemia. Prevent with aggressive hydration + rasburicase (↓ uric acid) + dialysis if needed. Rhabdomyolysis: good prognosis with aggressive IV hydration + hyperkalemia treatment. AKI common (30-50%), dialysis may be needed, but most recover renal function. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis: attacks self-limited (resolve in hours), no permanent weakness between attacks. Acetazolamide prevents attacks (80-90% effective). Normal lifespan.",
