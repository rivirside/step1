            definition: "Thyroid hormone deficiency (↓ T4/T3) causing decreased metabolism. Most commonly from Hashimoto thyroiditis (US) or iodine deficiency (worldwide). Primary hypothyroidism: thyroid gland problem (↑ TSH, ↓ T4). Secondary: pituitary problem (↓ TSH, ↓ T4).",
            pathophysiology: "Thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) regulate metabolic rate of nearly all cells. Synthesized in thyroid follicular cells: iodide uptake → organification → MIT/DIT coupling → T4 (thyroxine, 90% of secretion) and T3 (triiodothyronine, more potent). HPT axis: hypothalamus releases TRH → pituitary releases TSH → thyroid releases T4/T3. T4 is converted peripherally to active T3 by deiodinases. PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM (95% of cases): thyroid gland failure → ↓ T4/T3 → ↑ TSH (negative feedback lost). Causes: (1) Hashimoto thyroiditis (most common in US): autoimmune destruction of thyroid by anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, lymphocytic infiltration, follicular atrophy. (2) Iodine deficiency (most common worldwide): insufficient substrate for hormone synthesis → goiter from TSH stimulation. (3) Iatrogenic: radioactive iodine ablation, thyroidectomy, neck radiation, medications (lithium, amiodarone). SECONDARY HYPOTHYROIDISM (5%): pituitary TSH deficiency → ↓ T4/T3 + ↓ TSH. Causes: pituitary adenoma, surgery, Sheehan syndrome, hypopituitarism. TERTIARY (rare): hypothalamic TRH deficiency. Effects of deficiency: ↓ BMR → weight gain, cold intolerance, fatigue. ↓ sympathetic activity → bradycardia, constipation. ↓ cardiac contractility → diastolic dysfunction, pericardial effusion. Myxedema: accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in interstitium → non-pitting edema.",

            pathophysiology: "TWO DEFECTS: (1) INSULIN RESISTANCE: peripheral tissues (muscle, adipose, liver) resistant to insulin action → glucose cannot enter cells → hyperglycemia. Mechanisms: ↓ insulin receptor expression, ↓ post-receptor signaling (IRS-1, PI3K defects), ↑ free fatty acids (lipotoxicity), ↑ inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 from adipose tissue), ectopic fat deposition. (2) PROGRESSIVE β CELL DYSFUNCTION: initially β cells compensate by producing more insulin (hyperinsulinemia) → eventually β cells fail from chronic stress (glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, amyloid deposition) → relative insulin deficiency. NATURAL HISTORY: Years of insulin resistance + compensatory hyperinsulinemia (normoglycemia) → prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose 100-125 or impaired glucose tolerance) → overt diabetes (β cell function <50%). By time of diagnosis, 50% of β cell function lost. METABOLIC EFFECTS: Insulin resistance → hepatic glucose overproduction (↑ gluconeogenesis despite hyperglycemia). Hyperglycemia → osmotic diuresis → polyuria, polydipsia. Some insulin present → prevents lipolysis/ketosis (unlike T1DM - NOT ketosis-prone). Chronic hyperglycemia → microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy).
