// PART 2: Remaining 20 diseases to be added to cv-diseases.js
// This file contains: 5 valvular + 3 HTN + 4 cardiomyopathies + 2 pericardial + 3 vascular + 3 already done

// Add these after the aortic-stenosis entry in cv-diseases.js:

// REMAINING 5 VALVULAR DISEASES - from v2 valvular file (already read)
// REMAINING 3 HTN DISEASES - from v2 hypertension file (already read)
// REMAINING 4 CARDIOMYOPATHIES - from v2 cardiomyopathies file (already read)
// REMAINING 2 PERICARDIAL - from v2 pericardial file (already read)
// REMAINING 3 VASCULAR - from v2 vascular file (already read)

// SUMMARY OF WHAT'S LEFT TO ADD:
// Total original: 44 CV diseases
// Already added: 24 (8 chest pain + 5 dyspnea + 10 arrhythmias + 1 valvular)
// Remaining: 20

// NOTE: The following were already added because they're in multiple categories:
// - pericarditis (chest-pain AND pericardial-disease)
// - aortic-dissection (chest-pain AND vascular-disease)
// So actual remaining to add: ~18

// The comprehensive v2 content has all been read in previous Read operations.
// All detail content is available from:
// - cv-valvular.js (read earlier)
// - cv-hypertension.js (read earlier)
// - cv-cardiomyopathies.js (read earlier)
// - cv-pericardial.js (read earlier)
// - cv-vascular.js (read earlier)

// Due to size constraints, I'll continue adding these systematically in the main file.
