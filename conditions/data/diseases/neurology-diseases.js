            definition: "Recurrent primary headache disorder characterized by moderate-to-severe, typically unilateral, pulsating headache lasting 4-72 hours. Associated with nausea/vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia. May be preceded by aura (visual, sensory, or speech disturbances). Most common disabling headache disorder. Affects 12% of population (18% women, 6% men). Diagnosed clinically using ICHD-3 criteria (≥5 attacks meeting specific duration, quality, severity, and associated symptom criteria). Treatment: acute (triptans, NSAIDs) + preventive (β-blockers, antiepileptics, CGRP inhibitors).",
            pathophysiology: "Multifactorial neurovascular disorder involving CORTICAL SPREADING DEPRESSION (CSD) → trigeminovascular activation → neuropeptide release → sterile neurogenic inflammation. MIGRAINE AURA (occurs in 25%): wave of neuronal depolarization followed by suppression spreading across cerebral cortex at 2-3 mm/min (Leão's spreading depression). Triggers activation of trigeminal nerve endings surrounding meningeal blood vessels. TRIGEMINOVASCULAR SYSTEM ACTIVATION: trigeminal nerve (CN V) releases neuropeptides (CGRP - calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P, neurokinin A) → vasodilation + plasma protein extravasation → sterile inflammation of meninges/vessels → pain. CGRP is key mediator (elevated during migraine attacks). CENTRAL SENSITIZATION: repeated nociceptive input → hypersensitivity of trigeminal nucleus caudalis and thalamus → allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli - e.g., brushing hair hurts). GENETIC FACTORS: familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) - autosomal dominant mutations in ion channels (CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A) → cortical hyperexcitability. SEROTONIN (5-HT) DYSREGULATION: ↓ 5-HT during attacks → impaired descending pain modulation. Triptans work as 5-HT1B/1D agonists → vasoconstriction + ↓ CGRP release.",
            epidemiology: "PREVALENCE: 12% of general population (38 million in US). Women 18%, Men 6% (3:1 female predominance). PEAK AGE: onset typically 10-40 years. Peak prevalence 35-45 years. Rare before puberty (equal sex ratio in children). FEMALE PREDOMINANCE: estrogen fluctuations trigger attacks. 60% of women report menstrual association. Migraine often improves during pregnancy (2nd-3rd trimester - stable estrogen) and after menopause. FAMILY HISTORY: 70-90% have positive family history (complex polygenic inheritance). FHM = autosomal dominant. GLOBAL BURDEN: 2nd most disabling condition worldwide (WHO). Leading cause of disability in people <50 years. Average 4-6 headache days per month. Chronic migraine (≥15 headache days/month) affects 2% of population.",

            definition: "Most common primary headache disorder (affects 40-80% of population at some point). Characterized by bilateral, pressing/tightening (non-pulsating), mild-to-moderate intensity headache without significant associated symptoms. Duration 30 minutes to 7 days. NOT aggravated by routine physical activity (key difference from migraine). No nausea/vomiting (migraine has nausea). May have photophobia OR phonophobia but NOT both (migraine has both). Episodic (ETTH - <15 days/month) vs chronic (CTTH - ≥15 days/month for >3 months). Pathophysiology: likely myofascial (pericranial muscle tenderness) + central sensitization. Diagnosis: clinical (ICHD-3 criteria) - diagnosis of exclusion (no diagnostic test). Treatment: episodic - NSAIDs, acetaminophen, stress management. Chronic - preventive therapy (amitriptyline), avoid medication overuse. Generally benign, not life-threatening.",
            pathophysiology: "MULTIFACTORIAL - NOT fully understood. Previously thought to be purely muscular ('muscle contraction headache') but now recognized as complex interaction of PERIPHERAL and CENTRAL mechanisms. PERIPHERAL MECHANISMS (myofascial): PERICRANIAL MUSCLE TENDERNESS - increased tenderness to palpation of pericranial muscles (temporalis, masseter, frontalis, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, suboccipital). Present in most tension-type headache patients. Mechanism: prolonged muscle contraction → ischemia, lactic acid accumulation, release of inflammatory mediators (bradykinin, prostaglandins) → activation of peripheral nociceptors. Triggers: stress, anxiety, poor posture (forward head, rounded shoulders - 'text neck'), jaw clenching (bruxism), eye strain, lack of sleep. EMG studies: NORMAL muscle activity at rest (contradicts 'muscle contraction' theory - muscles not in sustained contraction, but have ↑ tenderness). CENTRAL SENSITIZATION (chronic tension-type headache): Repeated nociceptive input from pericranial muscles → sensitization of second-order neurons in trigeminal nucleus caudalis and dorsal horn (C1-C3) → ↓ pain threshold, ↑ response to stimuli. Central pain processing dysfunction (impaired descending pain modulation from periaqueductal gray, raphe nuclei). Neurochemical changes: ↓ serotonin (5-HT), ↓ endorphins, ↑ substance P, ↑ nitric oxide (NO). NO pathway: stress → ↑ NO synthase → ↑ NO → vasodilation + sensitization of nociceptors. Rationale for preventive therapy (amitriptyline - ↑ serotonin/NE, modulate pain pathways). EPISODIC vs CHRONIC: Episodic - predominantly peripheral (myofascial). Chronic (≥15 days/month) - central sensitization predominates (similar to chronic migraine). Overlap with migraine: some patients have both migraine + tension-type headache (comorbidity). Chronic tension-type headache may represent transformation from episodic tension-type or chronic migraine (medication overuse can drive transformation). PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS: stress, anxiety, depression strongly associated. Muscle tension from psychological stress → peripheral input → central sensitization. Vicious cycle: headache → anxiety/stress → more headache.",
            epidemiology: "LIFETIME PREVALENCE: 40-80% (most common headache disorder). 1-year prevalence: 40-60%.

Frequent episodic (1-14 days/month): 20-30%. CHRONIC TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE (CTTH): 2-3% of general population. ≥15 headache days/month for >3 months. Often daily or near-daily. Female > male (1.5:1 female predominance, less pronounced than migraine's 3:1). Overlap with chronic migraine (30-40% of chronic daily headache patients have features of both). AGE: can occur at any age. Peak prevalence 30-39 years. Often begins in adolescence/young adulthood. BURDEN: significant impact on quality of life, work productivity (lost workdays, presenteeism).

Prognosis excellent. Transformation to chronic form rare (3% per year). CHRONIC TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE: more persistent, challenging to treat. Daily or near-daily headache. WITHOUT treatment: headache persists for years, quality of life impaired, risk of medication overuse headache. WITH treatment (preventive medication + non-pharmacologic strategies + avoid medication overuse): 50-70% achieve ≥50% reduction in headache frequency. 20-30% revert to episodic form. Improvement often gradual (months). Relapse common if discontinue preventive therapy prematurely or stressors recur. FACTORS PREDICTING BETTER PROGNOSIS: younger age, episodic form, short duration, identifiable/modifiable triggers (stress, poor posture), willingness to engage in non-pharmacologic strategies (CBT, stress management, exercise), no medication overuse, no comorbid depression/anxiety. FACTORS PREDICTING WORSE PROGNOSIS: chronic form (≥15 days/month), long duration (>5 years), medication overuse headache, comorbid depression/anxiety (untreated), high stress/poor coping, lack of response to multiple preventive trials, disability (work loss, social withdrawal). LONG-TERM OUTCOMES: many patients have fluctuating course (periods of frequent headaches alternating with remission). Some have persistent low-level background headache. Overall, tension-type headache does NOT cause permanent neurologic damage, brain injury, or death (purely functional disorder). With appropriate management (preventive therapy, stress management, avoid medication overuse), most patients achieve acceptable quality of life.

Characterized by SEVERE, STRICTLY UNILATERAL periorbital/temporal pain with IPSILATERAL AUTONOMIC symptoms (lacrimation, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, ptosis, miosis). Duration 15-180 minutes (typically 30-90 min). Attacks occur in CLUSTERS (1-8 attacks/day for weeks-months) separated by remission periods (months-years). CIRCADIAN pattern (attacks at same time daily, often nocturnal 1-2 hours after sleep onset). RESTLESSNESS/agitation during attack (vs migraine - prefers stillness). Male predominance (3:1). Onset age 20-40yo. Episodic (80-90% - cluster periods with remissions) vs chronic (10-20% - attacks ≥1 year without remission >3 months). Pathophysiology: hypothalamic activation (circadian pattern) + trigeminal-autonomic reflex. Diagnosis: clinical (ICHD-3 criteria). Treatment: acute - 100% oxygen 12-15 L/min (first-line, NNT 3), sumatriptan SC 6 mg (NNT 2). Preventive - verapamil 240-960 mg/day (first-line), consider lithium, topiramate. Avoid alcohol (trigger). Excellent response to oxygen/triptans (diagnostic clue). Benign prognosis (no mortality) but devastating quality of life during clusters.",
            pathophysiology: "MULTIFACTORIAL - involves HYPOTHALAMIC activation + TRIGEMINAL-AUTONOMIC REFLEX. PRIMARY GENERATOR (central hypothesis): POSTERIOR HYPOTHALAMUS activation (specifically suprachiasmatic nucleus) drives circadian pattern. Functional imaging (PET, fMRI) shows ipsilateral hypothalamic activation during attacks. Hypothalamus regulates circadian rhythms, explaining: (1) attacks at same time daily ('alarm clock headache'), (2) seasonal clustering (more common spring/fall), (3) nocturnal attacks (1-2 hours after sleep onset during REM sleep). TRIGEMINAL-AUTONOMIC REFLEX: hypothalamic activation → trigeminal nerve activation → substance P, CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) release → vasodilation + neurogenic inflammation → severe pain. Simultaneously, parasympathetic outflow (superior salivatory nucleus) → cranial parasympathetic activation → ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (lacrimation via lacrimal gland, rhinorrhea via nasal mucosa, conjunctival injection via vasodilation). Sympathetic dysfunction (carotid plexus) → Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis). CAROTID ARTERY involvement: internal carotid artery vasodilation (demonstrated by MRA during attacks). May compress sympathetic plexus → partial Horner syndrome. OXYGEN MECHANISM: vasoconstriction (counteracts vasodilation), increased oxygen availability to ischemic tissue, modulation of hypothalamic activity. GENETIC COMPONENT: familial clustering in 5-20% (autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance). OREXIN (hypocretin) hypothesis: orexinergic neurons in hypothalamus may play role (orexin levels ↓ during cluster periods). NITRIC OXIDE: potent vasodilator, can trigger cluster attacks (nitroglycerin provocation test).",
            epidemiology: "PREVALENCE: 0.1% (1 in 1000) - rare compared to migraine (12%). Lifetime prevalence 0.05-0.1%. MALE PREDOMINANCE: 3:1 male-to-female ratio (historically 6-7:1, but gap narrowing - may be due to ↑ smoking in women). Most severely male-predominant primary headache. AGE OF ONSET: typically 20-40 years (peak 30 years). Can occur at any age (children to elderly). Median age of onset earlier than migraine. EPISODIC vs CHRONIC: EPISODIC cluster headache 80-90% (cluster periods lasting weeks to months, separated by remission periods lasting months to years. Median cluster period 6-12 weeks, median remission 1 year). CHRONIC cluster headache 10-20% (attacks for ≥1 year without remission, or remission <3 months. 10-15% start as episodic then become chronic. 10% chronic from onset). SMOKING ASSOCIATION: 65-90% of cluster headache patients are smokers or ex-smokers (vs 30% general population). Strong association but causality unclear. SEASONAL VARIATION: clusters more common during spring and fall (circadian/seasonal trigger). GEOGRAPHIC: no significant racial or geographic variation. FAMILY HISTORY: 5-20% have first-degree relative with cluster headache (genetic component).",

            presentation: "HEADACHE CHARACTERISTICS (ICHD-3 criteria): SEVERITY: EXCRUCIATING, described as 'worst pain imaginable', 'hot poker in eye', 'drilling', 'boring'. Pain intensity 10/10 (suicide headache). Far more severe than migraine. LOCATION: STRICTLY UNILATERAL (never switches sides during attack, usually same side throughout cluster period. 10-15% switch sides between cluster periods). Periorbital (around eye - most common), temporal, forehead. Can radiate to jaw, teeth, neck (same side). QUALITY: sharp, stabbing, boring, burning, constant (NOT throbbing/pulsating unlike migraine). DURATION: 15-180 minutes (ICHD-3 criterion). Median 30-90 minutes. Much shorter than migraine (4-72 hours). Reaches maximum intensity within 5-15 minutes (rapid onset). FREQUENCY: 1-8 attacks per day during cluster period (median 1-2/day). Up to 8 attacks/day in some. TIMING/CIRCADIAN PATTERN (HALLMARK): attacks occur at SAME TIME each day ('alarm clock headache'). Often NOCTURNAL, 1-2 hours after sleep onset (during REM sleep - 60-70% have nocturnal attacks). Morning attacks also common (6-8 AM). Circadian pattern strongest diagnostic clue. CLUSTER PERIODS: attacks occur in clusters lasting weeks to months (median 6-12 weeks), then remission for months to years (median 1 year). TRIGGERS during cluster period (NOT during remission): alcohol (30-60 min after consumption - most reliable trigger, 50-70%), nitroglycerin, strong smells, warm environment, stress. NO food triggers (unlike migraine - no association with chocolate, cheese, MSG). AUTONOMIC SYMPTOMS (ESSENTIAL for diagnosis - must be ipsilateral to pain): lacrimation (tearing - 80-90%), conjunctival injection (red eye - 80%), rhinorrhea (runny nose - 60-70%), nasal congestion (60%), ptosis (drooping eyelid - 50%), miosis (small pupil - 30%) = partial Horner syndrome, forehead/facial sweating (60%), eyelid edema (40%), facial flushing. At least ONE autonomic symptom required for diagnosis. RESTLESSNESS/AGITATION (80-90%): CANNOT lie still (vs migraine prefers stillness in dark room). Pacing, rocking, head banging, going outside in cold air. Highly characteristic. Sense of restlessness, inner agitation. ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS: sensitivity to light/sound can occur but MUCH LESS prominent than migraine. NO nausea/vomiting typically (unlike migraine). Agitation, anxiety, panic during attack.

However, DEVASTATING quality of life during cluster periods ('suicide headache' - patients describe as worse pain than childbirth, kidney stones). EPISODIC CLUSTER HEADACHE (80-90%): CLUSTER PERIODS last weeks to months (median 6-12 weeks), separated by REMISSION periods (median 1 year, range months to years). During remission, completely pain-free (no attacks). Cluster periods may become SHORTER, LESS FREQUENT, or LESS INTENSE with age (50% improve over time). 10-15% transition to chronic cluster headache. Remission periods may lengthen over time. Some patients have spontaneous remission after many years. CHRONIC CLUSTER HEADACHE (10-20%): WORSE prognosis. Continuous attacks for ≥1 year without remission (or remission <3 months). More refractory to treatment. Requires long-term preventive therapy. 20% of chronic may revert to episodic. Lower quality of life, higher disability, higher depression/suicide risk. TREATMENT RESPONSE: EXCELLENT response to acute therapy (oxygen 70-80%, sumatriptan SC 75% within 15 min). Preventive therapy (verapamil) effective in 60-70%. Early diagnosis + aggressive treatment → much better quality of life. Delay in diagnosis common (average 5-7 years from first attack to diagnosis - often misdiagnosed as migraine, sinusitis). SUICIDE RISK: cluster headache has HIGHER rate of suicidal ideation than other headache disorders (20% contemplate suicide during severe attacks). Adequate treatment essential. Screen for depression. AGE-RELATED CHANGES: cluster headache may SPONTANEOUSLY REMIT in 10-15% after age 60-70. Frequency/severity often ↓ with age. DISABILITY: episodic cluster headache → intermittent disability during cluster periods (weeks to months). Chronic cluster → chronic disability (work loss, social isolation, depression). With optimal treatment (acute + preventive), most patients can maintain function during cluster periods. REASSURANCE: cluster headache does NOT cause stroke, aneurysm, brain damage, dementia. Purely functional disorder (hypothalamic). Benign prognosis if treated. NOT life-threatening (but can be life-ruining if untreated).",

Common locations: basal ganglia (putamen most common, 35-50%), thalamus (20-30%), pons (5-10%), cerebellum (5-10%), lobar (10-20%). Deep hemorrhages (basal ganglia, thalamus, pons) = hypertensive. Lobar hemorrhages = amyloid angiopathy (elderly). (2) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA - 10-20%): amyloid deposition in cortical/leptomeningeal vessel walls → vessel fragility → lobar hemorrhages (recurrent). Elderly (>70), normotensive. (3) Other causes: AVM (arteriovenous malformation), aneurysm rupture, hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke, anticoagulation (warfarin, heparin, DOACs), sympathomimetics (cocaine, amphetamines), coagulopathy, tumor (glioblastoma, melanoma metastases), venous sinus thrombosis. Pathophysiology of injury: primary injury (mass effect, direct tissue destruction) + secondary injury (hematoma expansion first 3-6 hours, perihematomal edema, ↑ ICP, herniation, hydrocephalus from intraventricular hemorrhage).

            definition: "Transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal BRAIN, SPINAL CORD, or RETINAL ischemia WITHOUT acute infarction (tissue-based definition, not time-based). Symptoms typically resolve within 1 hour (90%), though traditional time-based definition was <24 hours. KEY DIFFERENCE from stroke: NO permanent tissue damage on MRI DWI (no infarct). Often a WARNING SIGN of impending stroke - 10-20% risk of stroke within 90 days (highest risk in first 48 hours). 30-50% have DWI-positive lesion despite symptom resolution (these are 'tissue-based strokes', not true TIAs). Same causes as ischemic stroke: thrombotic (carotid atherosclerosis), embolic (A-fib, cardiac source), lacunar (small vessel disease from HTN/DM). ABCD2 score predicts stroke risk (Age ≥60, BP ≥140/90, Clinical features, Duration, Diabetes). High-risk TIA = ABCD2 ≥4, large vessel stenosis ≥50%, or DWI-positive → admit, urgent workup. Treatment: immediate dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel × 21 days if minor stroke/high-risk TIA), statin, BP control, anticoagulation if cardioembolic, carotid revascularization if stenosis ≥50%. TIA is medical EMERGENCY - 'brain attack', urgent evaluation required (stroke can occur within hours). Prognosis: 10-20% stroke risk within 90 days (50% of strokes occur within 2 days of TIA), 30% lifetime stroke risk if untreated. With treatment (antiplatelet, statin, risk factor control), stroke risk ↓ to 2-5% per year.",
            pathophysiology: "SAME mechanisms as ischemic stroke, but ischemia is TRANSIENT and does NOT cause permanent tissue damage (no infarction on MRI DWI). MECHANISMS: (1) THROMBOTIC (in situ atherosclerosis): atherosclerotic plaque in large artery (carotid, vertebral, basilar, intracranial vessels) → stenosis or plaque rupture → transient occlusion → ischemia. Symptoms resolve when occlusion clears (spontaneous lysis, collateral flow). Most common in carotid bifurcation (ICA origin), MCA stem, vertebrobasilar system. (2) EMBOLIC (cardiac or artery-to-artery): embolus from cardiac source (A-fib 50%, valvular disease, LV thrombus post-MI, PFO) or artery-to-artery (carotid plaque → embolus to MCA) lodges distally → transient occlusion → ischemia. Embolus spontaneously lyses or migrates distally → symptoms resolve. 'Shower emboli' from unstable carotid plaque can cause recurrent TIAs (crescendo TIAs - warning sign). (3) LACUNAR (small vessel disease): lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries from chronic HTN, diabetes → transient occlusion of lenticulostriate, thalamoperforator, pontine perforator vessels → lacunar TIA. (4) HEMODYNAMIC (hypoperfusion): transient systemic hypotension (orthostatic, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia) + fixed stenosis (carotid, vertebral) → watershed ischemia (border zones). Symptoms with standing, exertion. Limb-shaking TIA (involuntary shaking of arm/leg due to hypoperfusion distal to severe carotid stenosis). (5) HYPERCOAGULABLE STATES: antiphospholipid syndrome, protein C/S deficiency, factor V Leiden, sickle cell disease → transient thrombosis. WHY SYMPTOMS RESOLVE (vs stroke): (1) rapid spontaneous recanalization (embolus lyses, thrombus dissolves), (2) robust collateral circulation (circle of Willis, leptomeningeal collaterals prevent infarction), (3) brief duration of ischemia (ischemic penumbra salvaged before core infarction). TIME-BASED vs TISSUE-BASED DEFINITION: OLD definition (<24 hours symptom duration) → MANY 'TIAs' had DWI-positive infarcts (30-50%) = actually strokes. NEW definition (2009 AHA/ASA): TIA = transient ischemia WITHOUT infarction on MRI DWI (tissue-based). If DWI-positive → stroke (even if symptoms resolved). However, clinically, many still use time-based approach if MRI unavailable. RISK of STROKE after TIA: vulnerable period is first 48-72 hours (10% stroke risk within 2 days). Mechanism: same underlying lesion (unstable plaque, A-fib) that caused TIA → full-blown stroke. TIA is 'final warning'.",
            epidemiology: "INCIDENCE: 200,000-500,000 TIAs per year in US (exact number uncertain - many go unreported or unrecognized). PREVALENCE: ~2.3% of US adults have had TIA. AGE: risk ↑ with age (median age 70 years, uncommon <50yo unless specific risk factors like PFO, vasculitis, hypercoagulable state). GENDER: Men slightly > Women (1.3:1). RACE: Black > White (higher HTN prevalence). UNDERDIAGNOSIS: 50% of TIAs may go unreported (patients dismiss transient symptoms, don't seek care). RECURRENCE: 10-20% risk of STROKE within 90 days after TIA (50% of these strokes occur within first 2 days, 80% within 7 days). 30% lifetime stroke risk if untreated. ABCD2 SCORE EPIDEMIOLOGY: high-risk TIA (ABCD2 ≥4) → 8% stroke risk at 2 days, 12% at 7 days, 18% at 90 days. Low-risk (ABCD2 0-3) → 1% at 2 days, 1.2% at 7 days, 3% at 90 days. CAROTID STENOSIS: 30% of TIAs due to carotid stenosis. Ipsilateral stenosis ≥50% → 20% stroke risk within 2 weeks. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: accounts for 20-30% of TIAs. Annual stroke risk with A-fib 5% (↓ to 1-2% with anticoagulation). YOUNG PATIENTS (<50yo): TIA in young → consider PFO (20-40%), dissection, hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, drug use (cocaine).",

Traditional definition <24hrs, but if >1hr, more likely to have DWI infarct = stroke). SYMPTOMS depend on VASCULAR TERRITORY: (1) ANTERIOR CIRCULATION (carotid, MCA, ACA - 80% of TIAs): MOTOR: unilateral weakness (hemiparesis - face, arm, leg; MCA → face/arm > leg, ACA → leg > arm). SENSORY: unilateral numbness/paresthesias (hemihypesthesia - same distribution). SPEECH: aphasia if dominant hemisphere (left in 95%). Expressive (Broca - can't speak, comprehension intact), receptive (Wernicke - fluent nonsense, poor comprehension), global (both impaired). Dysarthria (slurred speech, intact language - subcortical). VISUAL: monocular vision loss (amaurosis fugax - 'curtain coming down' over one eye, painless, seconds to minutes. Due to retinal artery occlusion from ipsilateral carotid stenosis/embolus. Ophthalmoscopy may show Hollenhorst plaque - cholesterol crystal in retinal artery). Hemianopsia (homonymous - MCA/PCA), neglect (right MCA → left neglect). GAZE: gaze preference toward lesion ('looking at lesion, away from hemiparesis'). (2) POSTERIOR CIRCULATION (vertebrobasilar - 20% of TIAs): VERTIGO (isolated vertigo rarely TIA unless other brainstem symptoms - consider peripheral vertigo. Central vertigo: vertical/torsional nystagmus, absent latency, no fatigue). DIPLOPIA, dysarthria, dysphagia (brainstem). ATAXIA, nystagmus (cerebellar). CROSSED SIGNS (ipsilateral cranial nerve deficit + contralateral motor/sensory deficit - brainstem localization). Drop attacks (sudden falls without LOC - bilateral pontine ischemia affecting reticular formation). Bilateral visual loss (PCA → bilateral occipital ischemia). (3) LACUNAR TIA (small vessel): pure motor hemiparesis (internal capsule), pure sensory stroke (thalamus), ataxic hemiparesis (pons), dysarthria-clumsy hand (pons/internal capsule). NO cortical signs (no aphasia, neglect, hemianopsia). SYMPTOM EVOLUTION: symptoms are SUDDEN onset (vs migraine aura - gradual spread over 5-20 min, positive symptoms like scintillations), MAXIMUM at onset, and RESOLVING (complete resolution within 1hr typical, <24hr by definition). NEGATIVE symptoms (loss of function - weakness, numbness, vision loss) vs migraine aura (positive symptoms - flashing lights, paresthesias, then negative). MIMICS to exclude: hypoglycemia (confusion, sweating, tremor - check glucose), seizure (Todd's paralysis - post-ictal weakness lasting minutes-hours; seizure has positive symptoms - jerking, LOC, tongue biting, incontinence), migraine aura (gradual spread, positive symptoms, history of migraine, younger age, headache follows aura), syncope/presyncope (global cerebral hypoperfusion - LOC, no focal deficit. If focal deficit → TIA/stroke, not syncope). CRESCENDO TIAs: multiple TIAs over hours-days, same vascular territory (e.g., repetitive left arm weakness).

WITH OPTIMAL TREATMENT (dual antiplatelet × 21 days, statin, BP control, anticoagulation if cardioembolic, CEA/CAS if stenosis ≥50%): stroke risk ↓ to 2-5% per year (long-term). MORTALITY: 30-day mortality after TIA is LOW (1-2%, much lower than stroke 10-15%). However, 5-year mortality 20-25% (mostly from cardiovascular events - MI, cardiac death, reflecting high vascular risk burden). FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME: most TIA patients have COMPLETE recovery (by definition, symptoms resolve). However, 10-15% have subtle residual deficits (mild cognitive changes, subtle weakness). Quality of life often impaired due to anxiety, fear of stroke, medication burden. RECURRENCE: 30% lifetime risk of stroke if UNTREATED. With treatment, 5-year stroke risk 10-15%. MODIFIABLE FACTORS improving prognosis: early treatment (dual antiplatelet within 24hrs ↓ stroke risk 25-30%, NNT 45), carotid revascularization if stenosis ≥50% (↓ stroke risk 50-70%, NNT 6), anticoagulation for A-fib (↓ stroke risk 60-70%, NNT 25), high-intensity statin (↓ stroke risk 15-20%, NNT 45), BP control <130/80 (↓ stroke risk 30%, NNT 9 over 4 years). POOR PROGNOSTIC FACTORS: age >60, diabetes, HTN >140/90, duration ≥60 min (ABCD2 components), large vessel stenosis ≥70%, DWI-positive infarct, cardioembolic source, crescendo TIAs, medication non-adherence. REASSURANCE: TIA itself is REVERSIBLE (no permanent tissue damage). Excellent opportunity for SECONDARY PREVENTION (identify risk factors, start treatment BEFORE stroke occurs).

Progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by insidious onset of memory loss (especially short-term/recent memory), followed by executive dysfunction, language impairment, visuospatial deficits, and behavioral changes. Pathology: extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques + intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (hyperphosphorylated tau protein) → neuronal death, especially in hippocampus and cortex. Mean survival 8-10 years from diagnosis. Diagnosis: clinical (progressive cognitive decline + impaired ADLs) + exclude reversible causes. MRI shows cortical/hippocampal atrophy. Treatment: cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) + NMDA antagonist (memantine) for moderate-severe disease. Supportive care critical.",
            pathophysiology: "AMYLOID CASCADE HYPOTHESIS (central to pathogenesis): abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide → oligomer formation → extracellular SENILE PLAQUES → neurotoxicity → neuronal dysfunction/death. Aβ derives from amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaved by β-secretase and γ-secretase (vs normal α-secretase cleavage → non-toxic fragments). Aβ42 (42 amino acids) is most toxic and aggregates more readily than Aβ40. GENETIC RISK: Early-onset AD (<65 years, <5% of cases): AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT mutations in APP (chromosome 21), presenilin-1 (PSEN1 - chromosome 14, most common), presenilin-2 (PSEN2 - chromosome 1) → ↑ Aβ42 production. Late-onset AD (>65 years, >95% of cases): APOE ε4 allele (chromosome 19) is strongest genetic risk factor. APOE ε4/ε4 homozygotes: 10-15× ↑ risk. APOE ε2 is protective. APOE ε4 → impaired Aβ clearance. TAU PATHOLOGY (neurofibrillary tangles - NFTs): hyperphosphorylated tau protein (normally stabilizes microtubules) → dissociates from microtubules → aggregates into paired helical filaments → intracellular NFTs → microtubule destabilization → impaired axonal transport → neuronal death. NFT distribution follows Braak staging (I-VI): starts in entorhinal cortex/hippocampus (early memory loss) → spreads to neocortex (global cognitive decline). NEURONAL LOSS: preferential loss of cholinergic neurons in basal forebrain (nucleus basalis of Meynert) → ↓ acetylcholine (ACh) in cortex/hippocampus → memory/cognitive deficits. Rationale for cholinesterase inhibitors. INFLAMMATORY CASCADE: activated microglia and astrocytes surround plaques → release inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) → chronic neuroinflammation → neuronal injury. OXIDATIVE STRESS: Aβ → mitochondrial dysfunction → ↑ reactive oxygen species (ROS) → lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, protein oxidation. SYNAPTIC LOSS: earliest change (precedes neuronal death). Loss of dendritic spines and synapses → cognitive decline. GROSS PATHOLOGY: cortical atrophy (especially temporal and parietal lobes), hippocampal atrophy, widened sulci, enlarged ventricles (ex vacuo hydrocephalus from tissue loss).",
            epidemiology: "PREVALENCE: ~6 million in US, 50 million worldwide. Most common cause of dementia (60-80%).

AGE: typically late-onset (>65 years, 95% of cases). Early-onset (<65 years, 5%) - often familial/genetic. GENDER: Women > Men (2:1) - partly due to longer life expectancy, but sex-specific factors may contribute (estrogen loss post-menopause, APOE ε4 confers higher risk in women). RACE/ETHNICITY: African Americans 2× higher risk, Hispanics 1.5× higher risk vs non-Hispanic whites (likely due to higher rates of vascular risk factors - HTN, DM, obesity). FAMILIAL: 25-50% have positive family history. First-degree relatives have 2-3× ↑ risk. APOE ε4 present in 40% of AD patients (vs 15% general population). EARLY-ONSET AD: autosomal dominant mutations (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) account for <1% of all AD but 10-15% of early-onset cases. Penetrance nearly 100%. DOWN SYNDROME: virtually all develop AD pathology by age 40 (APP gene on chromosome 21 - trisomy 21 → ↑ APP → ↑ Aβ). GLOBAL BURDEN: 6th leading cause of death in US. 5th leading cause in ≥65 years.

Early-onset AD (<65 years): faster progression, shorter survival (6-8 years). Late-onset AD (>65 years): slower progression, longer survival (8-12 years). Age at diagnosis: younger age → longer survival (healthier baseline, fewer comorbidities). PROGRESSION: decline NOT linear. Slow early, accelerate in middle stages, plateau in late stages (floor effect - cannot decline further). Rate variable (some patients decline rapidly over 3-4 years, others slowly over 15-20 years). Factors associated with FASTER progression: younger onset, male sex, APOE ε4 homozygotes, low education, behavioral symptoms, psychosis, extrapyramidal signs, myoclonus, rapid early decline. FUNCTIONAL TRAJECTORY: Mild (3-5 years): independent in basic ADLs, need help with IADLs (finances, medications, driving). Moderate (2-3 years): need help with basic ADLs (bathing, dressing), incontinence develops, behavioral symptoms prominent. Severe (1-3 years): total care dependent, bedridden, minimal communication, dysphagia. CAUSE OF DEATH: most die FROM complications, not OF AD. Aspiration pneumonia (40-50%, most common), other infections (UTIs, sepsis), malnutrition/dehydration, cardiovascular events. AD is 6th leading cause of death in US (but likely undercounted - many deaths attributed to pneumonia, not underlying AD). MORTALITY PREDICTORS: advanced age, male sex, comorbidities (cardiovascular, DM), functional dependence, low BMI/weight loss, dysphagia, behavioral symptoms, nursing home placement.

            definition: "Autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) characterized by fluctuating, fatigable muscle weakness. Caused by antibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AChR) or muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) at postsynaptic membrane. Classic presentation: ptosis, diplopia, bulbar weakness worsening with repetitive use and throughout the day.",
            pathophysiology: "Antibody-mediated destruction of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at NMJ → ↓ available AChR → impaired neuromuscular transmission → muscle weakness. Pathophysiology: (1) Anti-AChR antibodies (85%): IgG antibodies bind to AChR → complement activation → membrane attack complex → receptor destruction. Also causes receptor internalization/degradation, direct receptor blockade. (2) Anti-MuSK antibodies (5-10%, seronegative MG): muscle-specific kinase (required for AChR clustering). IgG4 antibodies (non-complement fixing). More severe disease, worse response to treatment. (3) Seronegative MG (5-10%): no detectable antibodies (may have low-affinity anti-AChR or antibodies to other NMJ proteins - LRP4, agrin). Thymic abnormalities: 75% have thymic hyperplasia (follicular), 10-15% have thymoma (tumor). Thymus contains myoid cells (muscle-like cells expressing AChR) → may trigger autoimmune response. Repetitive nerve stimulation → ACh depletion → progressive ↓ in available ACh → ↓ muscle fiber activation → fatigue. Fatigability hallmark: weakness worsens with repetitive use (depleting ACh stores faster than can be replenished).",
            epidemiology: "Prevalence 150-250 per million (increasing due to better recognition, aging population). Incidence 8-10 per million per year. Bimodal age distribution: young women (20-40 years, peak 30), older men (60-80 years, peak 70). Overall slight female predominance (3:2), but male predominance in late-onset. Thymoma association: 10-15% of MG patients, 30-50% of thymoma patients develop MG.",

Cogan's lid twitch sign (brief eyelid overshoot after looking down then up). Ice pack test (ice on closed eyelid → improved ptosis). Bulbar weakness (60%): dysarthria (nasal, slurred speech - worsens with prolonged talking), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing - liquids > solids, nasal regurgitation), facial weakness (weak smile, inability to puff cheeks, 'myasthenic snarl' when smiling). Limb weakness (50%): proximal > distal, symmetric. Difficulty raising arms (combing hair, reaching overhead), climbing stairs. Neck weakness: head drop (neck extensors weak → difficulty holding head up). Respiratory weakness (15-20%): dyspnea, orthopnea, respiratory failure (MYASTHENIC CRISIS - medical emergency). NO SENSORY SYMPTOMS (purely motor). NO AUTONOMIC SYMPTOMS (vs Lambert-Eaton). REFLEXES NORMAL (vs neuropathy). Ocular-only MG (15%): symptoms confined to eyes for >2 years → likely remain ocular-only. Generalized MG: progresses from ocular to generalized within 2 years (85%).

Empiric antibiotics must be started immediately (do NOT wait for LP if delayed). Causative organism varies by age and immune status.",
            pathophysiology: "Bacterial invasion of subarachnoid space → meningeal inflammation → cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-1) → blood-brain barrier breakdown → cerebral edema, ↑ intracranial pressure, vasculitis, thrombosis → neuronal injury, seizures, stroke, herniation.

(2) Direct extension: sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis → local spread. (3) Skull fracture/neurosurgery: direct inoculation.

Previously called 'grand mal' seizure. Common clinical features: tongue biting (lateral tongue - specific for seizure), urinary incontinence, postictal confusion (Todd's paralysis if focal origin). Causes: epilepsy (genetic/structural), acute provoked seizures (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, alcohol withdrawal, drugs, CNS infection, stroke). First unprovoked seizure workup: MRI brain, EEG, labs (glucose, lytes, calcium, toxicology). Status epilepticus (seizure >5 min or recurrent without recovery) = medical emergency: treat with benzodiazepines → second-line AED (phenytoin, levetiracetam, valproate).",
            pathophysiology: "SEIZURE = abnormal, excessive, synchronized neuronal discharges in brain. GENERALIZED SEIZURE: involves BOTH hemispheres from onset (bilateral motor activity + loss of consciousness from start). TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE PHASES: (1) TONIC PHASE (10-30 sec): sustained muscle contraction → body/limb stiffening, back arching (opisthotonus), jaw clenching, eye rolling, cry/groan from forced expiration against closed glottis. Loss of consciousness immediate. Fall risk if standing. Breathing stops (apnea) → cyanosis. (2) CLONIC PHASE (30-60 sec): rhythmic muscle contractions and relaxations → bilateral jerking movements (initially rapid, then slowing frequency as phase ends). Tongue biting (lateral tongue - SPECIFIC for seizure vs syncope), incontinence (bladder/bowel), excessive salivation/frothing. (3) POSTICTAL PHASE (minutes to hours): gradual recovery of consciousness. Confusion, disorientation, lethargy, headache, muscle soreness. TODD'S PARALYSIS: transient focal neurologic deficit post-seizure (hemiparesis, aphasia) lasting minutes to 48 hrs. Suggests seizure had focal origin before generalizing (focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic). NEUROPHYSIOLOGY: imbalance between excitation (glutamate, NMDA/AMPA receptors) and inhibition (GABA). Excessive excitatory input or impaired inhibitory mechanisms → runaway neuronal firing → seizure. Generalized seizures arise from subcortical networks (thalamus, cortex) with rapid bilateral spread. MECHANISMS OF EPILEPTOGENESIS: ion channelopathies (Na+, K+, Ca2+ channels - genetic epilepsies), structural lesions (cortical dysplasia, hippocampal sclerosis, tumors, stroke), neurotransmitter imbalance, neuroinflammation, loss of inhibitory interneurons. GENETIC EPILEPSIES: mutations in SCN1A (Dravet syndrome), KCNQ2/KCNQ3 (benign familial neonatal seizures), GABRA1 (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). ACQUIRED EPILEPSIES: hippocampal sclerosis (most common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy), cortical dysplasia, post-traumatic, post-infectious, vascular malformations.",
            epidemiology: "SEIZURES: 10% of population will have ≥1 seizure in lifetime. EPILEPSY (≥2 unprovoked seizures): 1% lifetime prevalence (~3 million in US, 65 million worldwide). Incidence: bimodal distribution - highest in infancy/childhood (<1 year old - 150/100k) and elderly (>65 years - 100/100k). TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES: most recognizable seizure type. Can occur in ANY epilepsy syndrome. PRIMARY GENERALIZED EPILEPSY (seizures generalized from onset): juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening, childhood absence epilepsy (can progress to tonic-clonic). Onset typically adolescence/young adulthood. Strong genetic component. FOCAL-TO-BILATERAL TONIC-CLONIC (previously 'secondarily generalized'): seizure starts focally (one hemisphere) then spreads to bilateral. More common in adults. Associated with structural brain lesions (temporal lobe epilepsy, cortical dysplasia, stroke, tumor). ACUTE PROVOKED SEIZURES: 30-40% of first seizures have acute provoking factor (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, alcohol withdrawal, drugs - cocaine/amphetamines, CNS infection - meningitis/encephalitis, stroke, trauma). Lower recurrence risk than unprovoked seizures. AGE-SPECIFIC: neonates (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, inborn errors of metabolism), children (febrile seizures 2-5%, genetic epilepsies, infections), young adults (JME, trauma, drugs), elderly (stroke, neurodegenerative disease, tumors).",

Focal awareness (aura) depends on seizure origin - temporal lobe: déjà vu, fear, epigastric rising sensation. Frontal: motor jerking (Jacksonian march). Occipital: visual hallucinations. Parietal: sensory symptoms. If primary generalized: NO aura (sudden onset). TONIC PHASE (10-30 seconds): SUDDEN loss of consciousness. Fall to ground (injury risk - head trauma, fractures). TONIC muscle contraction: body/limb stiffening, back arching (opisthotonus), arms/legs extended or flexed. Eyes deviate upward or to side. Jaw clenched (risk tongue/cheek biting). Initial CRY/GROAN: forced air expulsion through closed vocal cords (NOT volitional). APNEA: breathing stops → cyanosis (bluish discoloration). Pupillary dilation. Autonomic: tachycardia, hypertension, salivation. CLONIC PHASE (30-60 seconds): rhythmic bilateral jerking movements of extremities, face, trunk. Initially rapid jerking, then gradually slowing in frequency and increasing in amplitude until movements stop. TONGUE BITING: lateral tongue biting highly specific for tonic-clonic seizure (vs syncope - tongue tip biting or none). INCONTINENCE: urinary incontinence common (30-50%), fecal less common. Excessive salivation/frothing at mouth (may be blood-tinged if tongue/cheek bitten). Continued autonomic activation: tachycardia, HTN, diaphoresis. POSTICTAL PHASE (minutes to hours): gradual return of consciousness. CONFUSION/DISORIENTATION: 'postictal confusion' is HALLMARK (helps distinguish from syncope - rapid recovery). Lethargy, somnolence. Headache, muscle soreness (from tonic contractions). TODD'S PARALYSIS (5-10%): transient focal neurologic deficit post-seizure (hemiparesis, hemiplegia, aphasia, vision loss) lasting minutes to 48 hours. Suggests focal onset. Resolves completely (vs stroke). Duration proportional to seizure duration. Amnesia for ictal period (patient does not remember seizure).

            pathophysiology: "SELECTIVE DEGENERATION of motor neurons (both UMN and LMN) with SPARING of sensory, autonomic, and oculomotor systems. UPPER MOTOR NEURONS (UMN): cell bodies in motor cortex (Betz cells, layer V) → axons travel via corticospinal tract (lateral columns of spinal cord) → synapse on LMN in anterior horn or brainstem motor nuclei. UMN degeneration → loss of descending inhibition → spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign. LOWER MOTOR NEURONS (LMN): cell bodies in anterior horn of spinal cord (for limbs/trunk) or brainstem motor nuclei (CN V, VII, IX, X, XII for bulbar muscles) → axons exit via ventral roots/cranial nerves → innervate skeletal muscle. LMN degeneration → denervation → weakness, atrophy, fasciculations. MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY: accumulation of misfolded proteins (TDP-43 in 97%, SOD1 in familial ALS) → ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions → neuronal dysfunction and death. TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43): normally nuclear protein involved in RNA processing. In ALS, mislocalizes to cytoplasm and aggregates. Hallmark of sporadic ALS and most familial ALS (except SOD1 mutations). GLUTAMATE EXCITOTOXICITY: impaired glutamate reuptake (↓ EAAT2 transporter on astrocytes) → excess synaptic glutamate → NMDA/AMPA receptor overactivation → ↑ Ca2+ influx → neuronal death. Rationale for riluzole (glutamate release inhibitor). OXIDATIVE STRESS: mitochondrial dysfunction → ↑ reactive oxygen species (ROS) → lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, DNA damage. Rationale for edaravone (free radical scavenger). NEUROINFLAMMATION: activated microglia and astrocytes → release inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide → contribute to motor neuron death. GENETIC FACTORS: 90-95% sporadic (unknown cause). 5-10% familial (autosomal dominant). Genes: C9orf72 (most common familial cause - 40%, hexanucleotide repeat expansion), SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1 - 20%, first gene identified, Cu/Zn-dependent enzyme), TARDBP (TDP-43 gene), FUS (fused in sarcoma). C9orf72 expansion also causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD-ALS overlap). PATHOLOGY (autopsy): loss of motor neurons in motor cortex, corticospinal tracts, anterior horns, brainstem motor nuclei. Reactive gliosis. Ubiquitinated inclusions (TDP-43 or SOD1). WHY MOTOR NEURONS SELECTIVELY VULNERABLE: large size (long axons), high metabolic demand, excitotoxic susceptibility, age-related decline in protective mechanisms.",

VARIABILITY: 20% survive >5 years. 10% survive >10 years. 5% survive >20 years ('long survivors' - Stephen Hawking lived 55 years with ALS, atypical). PREDICTORS OF SURVIVAL: POOR prognosis (shorter survival): bulbar onset (median 2-3 years vs 3-5 years limb onset). Older age at onset (>65 years - median 2 years). Respiratory onset (rare, <1 year survival). Rapid progression (short time from symptom onset to diagnosis). Low FVC at diagnosis (<50%). Weight loss/low BMI. C9orf72 mutation (cognitive/behavioral symptoms, faster progression). Male sex (modestly worse than female). BETTER prognosis (longer survival): younger onset (<40 years - median 5-10 years, some >20 years). Limb onset (especially lower limb - slowest progression). Long delay from symptom onset to diagnosis (slow early progression predicts slower overall course). High FVC at diagnosis (>80%). PLS phenotype (pure UMN - median >10 years, many do not progress to classic ALS). Flail arm/leg variants (slower spread to other regions). SOD1 mutations (some have very slow progression, e.g., SOD1 H46R). CAUSE OF DEATH: respiratory failure (80% - ventilatory insufficiency, aspiration pneumonia). 20% other causes (cardiovascular, sepsis, sudden death). TREATMENT EFFECT: riluzole prolongs survival by 2-3 months (modest). NIV prolongs survival by 7-11 months (more effective than riluzole). Tracheostomy/invasive MV can extend survival years (some >10 years) but locked-in state, requires 24-hour care. Multidisciplinary ALS clinic care improves survival vs standard care. QUALITY OF LIFE: progressively declines (loss of independence, communication, mobility). Depression common. Some patients maintain good quality of life with assistive technology, caregiver support. Patient-reported outcomes variable. LONG SURVIVORS (>10 years): 10% of ALS patients. Younger onset, limb onset, very slow progression.
