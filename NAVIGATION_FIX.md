# Header Navigation Fix

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Issue**: Header toggle buttons navigating to incorrect URLs
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

Users were getting lost when clicking the toggle buttons in the unified header because the URLs were incorrect:

```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
this.baseUrls = {
    conditions: 'http://localhost:8000',              // Wrong port
    medications: 'http://localhost:8765/index-v2.html', // Missing /medications/
    bugs: '#'
};
```

### Issues:
1. **Conditions URL** pointed to port 8000 (which wasn't running)
2. **Medications URL** was missing the `/medications/` path prefix

---

## Solution

Updated `shared/explorer-navigation.js` with correct URLs:

```javascript
// AFTER (CORRECT):
this.baseUrls = {
    conditions: 'http://localhost:8765/conditions/index.html',
    medications: 'http://localhost:8765/medications/index-v2.html',
    bugs: '#'
};
```

---

## What This Fixes

### ✅ Conditions Explorer Header
When you're viewing **Conditions** (http://localhost:8765/conditions/index.html):
- **Conditions button** - Blue, marked as active (you are here)
- **Medications button** - Click to navigate to http://localhost:8765/medications/index-v2.html
- **Bugs button** - Disabled (coming soon)

### ✅ Medications Explorer Header
When you're viewing **Medications** (http://localhost:8765/medications/index-v2.html):
- **Conditions button** - Click to navigate to http://localhost:8765/conditions/index.html
- **Medications button** - Purple, marked as active (you are here)
- **Bugs button** - Disabled (coming soon)

---

## Testing

### Manual Test:
1. Open Medications: http://localhost:8765/medications/index-v2.html
2. Click "Conditions" button in header
3. ✅ Should navigate to Conditions explorer
4. Click "Medications" button in header
5. ✅ Should navigate back to Medications explorer

### Visual Indicators:
- Active button has theme color (blue for conditions, purple for medications)
- Active button has white text
- Inactive buttons have gray text
- Hover shows background change

## Project Structure Clarification

**All files are in ONE project**:
```
/Users/rivir/Documents/GitHub/step1-conditions/
├── conditions/          # Conditions Explorer
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── script.js
│   └── styles.css
├── medications/         # Medications Explorer
│   ├── index-v2.html
│   ├── script-v2.js
│   └── styles.css
└── shared/             # Shared Design System
    ├── design-tokens.css
    ├── navigation.css
    ├── components.css
    ├── themes.css
    └── explorer-navigation.js  ← THIS FILE WAS FIXED
```

**Server Configuration**:
- Must run from parent directory: `/Users/rivir/Documents/GitHub/step1-conditions/`
- Port: 8765
- Command: `python3 -m http.server 8765`

This ensures both explorers can access the `/shared/` directory.

---

## Files Modified

1. **shared/explorer-navigation.js** (lines 16-20)
   - Updated `baseUrls` object with correct paths

2. **QUICK_START.md** (lines 1-43)
   - Added project structure diagram
   - Clarified server startup instructions
   - Confirmed navigation is working

---

## Benefits

1. **No More Getting Lost**: Toggle buttons navigate to correct locations
2. **Consistent Experience**: Same navigation pattern in both explorers
3. **Visual Feedback**: Active button shows which explorer you're in
4. **Single Project**: Everything in one unified codebase

---

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

Now that navigation works correctly, future phases can add:
1. **Context Preservation**: Remember what you were viewing when switching explorers
2. **Cross-Reference Links**: Blue links to conditions, purple links to medications
3. **Preview Tooltips**: Hover over links to see entity preview
4. **URL Deep Linking**: Share specific entities via URL parameters
